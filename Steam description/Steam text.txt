Three Natural Wonders give delayed boosts
- Fountain of Youth is now the Fountain of Culture
- El Dorado is now the Golden Eras El Dorado.
- King Solomon's Mines is now the Gold of King Solomon

Have a unit consistently on an updated Natural Wonder for a range of turns to receive: 
- A fountain of free culture
- A load of golden eras
- A huge number of gold

After the award, the Natural Wonder is reset for a range of turns, and then up for capture again.
